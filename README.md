# Sample Custom Azure Function Extension to work with AWS S3 Objects

This repository contains a [Custom Azure Function Extension](https://blog.siliconvalve.com/2023/02/20/build-your-own-azure-functions-binding-extensions/) which is used to interact with text files on AWS' S3 Object Storage service.

The implementation is trivial and would likely need additional work to be suitable for production use.

If you read the linked blog in the first paragraph you can see how you can test out the resulting assembly produced by this project.

You should be able to use VS Code, a Dev Container, or GitHub Codespaces to have a play with this.
